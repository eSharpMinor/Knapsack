# Knapsack
(Greedy and Dynamic) Implementation of Knapsack

In this repo, we implemented the famous knapsack problem in the greedy and dynamic variant.

To run the code, you can copy paste the line from script.txt and execute it via a linux console.
The "instance_1.csv" file is an example input for the Knapsackproblem, which contains 6 items, with 6 weights and 6 values.
The "file1.csv" file is the output on this instance (greedy variant).
